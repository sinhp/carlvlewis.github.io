<p>Bibb County Coroner Leon Jones said police received an anonymous call about 2 p.m. that a fully-clothed, dark-haired white woman in her late 30s or early 40s was lying dead in the bushes at 1284 Glendale Ave., near Houston Avenue. She had severe lacerations on her body from what appeared to be dog bites and had been dead for between six and eight hours, Jones said.<!--more--></p>
<p>Jones said a pack of pit bulls were found roaming around the yard of the home, but he would not say whether police suspected the woman was actually killed by the dogs.</p>
<p>“At this time, the cause of death is unknown, and police are investigating,” Jones said.</p>
<p>Jones said the woman had yet to be identified as of late Thursday afternoon. He said an autopsy to determine the cause of death would be performed Friday.</p>
<p>Neighbors said the home has been empty since the previous tenants moved about two weeks ago. They said people from the community often cut through the alley of the house as a shortcut to a nearby convenience store.</p>
<p>Kristia Hargrove, who lives down the street, said she’s seen the pit bulls outside the house for a few days now, and she knows of at least two people who have been bitten by them already.</p>
<p>“One of my best friends was bitten by one of those dogs the other day. She had teeth prints all over her. That’s why I don’t walk near that house or through that alley anymore,” Hargrove said.</p>
<p>Neighbor Peggy Johnson said she wasn’t convinced the dogs killed the woman. She said she recognized the woman’s body as someone she had seen walking around the neighborhood before.</p>
<p>“I think she was already dead and that the dogs just smelled blood and went ballistic. If the dogs had attacked her when she was alive, she would have screamed, and someone would have heard her,” Johnson said. “I don’t know what actually killed her, though.”</p>
<p>Macon police spokeswoman Jami Gaudet said police have yet to determine whether foul play was involved.</p>
<p>Anyone with information is asked to call police at 751-7500 or Macon Regional CrimeStoppers at (877) 68-CRIME.</p>
