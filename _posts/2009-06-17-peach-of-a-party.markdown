<p>Ask Andrew Mathis to name his favorite food and he’ll tell you in an instant.</p>
<p>“It’s peaches, no question,” he said.</p>
<p>Mathis, a 70-year-old from Fort Valley, worked at a peach farm earlier in life and hasn’t missed a single Georgia Peach Festival since the event was launched in 1986.</p>
<p><!--more-->Saturday, he made it out once again to the festival’s annual kickoff celebration at the Peach Shops of Byron.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t miss it for anything,” he said.</p>
<p>The celebration began at 5 p.m. and featured live music, arts and crafts vendors, a fireworks show and a foam party for the kids.</p>
<p>Festival director Rich Bennett said it was the biggest crowd he’s ever seen for the celebration.</p>
<p>Brandi Trivette, a vendor at the event who sells peach-scented candles she makes at her home in Warner Robins, said the crowd was good for business.</p>
<p>“The peach candle has been a real hit tonight. People here in Peach County sure do love their peaches,” Trivette said.</p>
<p>But for some people, such as Janet Wynne and her husband, David, this year’s Peach Festival isn’t just about the titular fruit.</p>
<p>“Peaches are great, but we’re more into motorcycles, which is why we’re here,” she said.</p>
<p>Wynne said she had never been to the Peach Festival before until she rode in the festival’s first Poker Run Saturday morning.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Wynne’s 3-year-old daughter, Erika, said she loved the foam party.</p>
<p>“It looks like snow,” she said.</p>
<p>J.B. Roberson, an author from Warner Robins, was at the celebration signing copies of her latest children’s book, “Cuddlee Bugs: Revenge o’ the Peach Potion.”</p>
<p>“It’s a book that’s actually a lot about the Peach Festival,” she said.</p>
<p>The bands 2 Finger Jester and The Skeeterz performed free shows during the celebration.</p>
<p>“I was a little worried Two Finger Jester might be too loud for the festival, but everybody seemed to love them,” Bennett said. Mathis, however, said he was holding out for The Skeeterz, a more traditional country band.</p>
<p>“I may be old, but I love to dance when they play my sort of music,” he said.</p>
<p>The festival concluded with a fireworks display shot off from behind the shopping center.</p>
<p>“The fireworks are always the best part,” Bennett said.</p>
<p>As the kickoff to the festival drew to a close, Bennett said he held high hopes for the rest of it.</p>
<p>“This is looking like it might be one of the best Peach festivals yet. We’ve already gotten more involvement than last year,” he said.</p>
