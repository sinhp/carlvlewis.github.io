excerpt: "This week, I put in my two weeks' notice at Savannah's Morning News Media
  and our parent company, Morris Publishing Group, to move back after the holiday
  to New York City to join an up-and-coming NYC-based startup.\n\nIn my year-and-a-half
  at the helm of the SMN's digital content and product development strategies, including
  launching dosavannah.com, I learned invaluable management skills, conflict resolution
  and the courage to push fearlessly for innovation, even when tradition and red tape
  got in the way. "

<p><em>Perhaps my favorite Instagram shot ever snapped for the <a href="http://instagram.com/savannahnow" target="_blank">@savannahnow</a> Instagram account, which we grew to nearly 2,000 followers in a year's time.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This week, I put in my two weeks' notice at Savannah's <a href="http://savannahnow.com" target="_blank">Morning News Media</a> and our parent company, <a href="http://morris.com" target="_blank">Morris Publishing Group</a>, to move back after the holiday to New York City to join an up-and-coming NYC-based startup.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">In my year-and-a-half at the helm of the SMN's digital content and product development strategies, including launching <a href="http://dosavannah.com" target="_blank">dosavannah.com</a>, I learned invaluable management skills, conflict resolution and the courage to push fearlessly for innovation, even when tradition and red tape got in the way. <!--more-->I also had the pleasure of leading an incredibly talented team of digital journalists, including <a href="http://janaykingsberry.com">Janay Kingsberry</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/catiemafera">Catie Mafera</a>, as well as working underneath media disruption visionaries such as <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pub/craig-sims/3/523/496">Craig Sims</a> and <a href="http://yelvington.com">Steve Yelvington</a>; talented digital marketers such as <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=2054314&amp;authType=NAME_SEARCH&amp;authToken=8qGQ&amp;locale=en_US&amp;srchid=953588771398146313327&amp;srchindex=1&amp;srchtotal=63&amp;trk=vsrp_people_res_name&amp;trkInfo=VSRPsearchId%3A953588771398146313327%2CVSRPtargetId%3A2054314%2CVSRPcmpt%3Aprimary" target="_blank">Stacy Jennings</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/jhaymanPR" target="_blank">Jessica Hayman</a>; and tireless sales professionals working around-the-clock to develop new revenue streams for local news, such as <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=41178946&amp;locale=en_US&amp;trk=tyah&amp;trkInfo=tarId%3A1398146633026%2Ctas%3Arachel%20gardner%2Cidx%3A1-1-1" target="_blank">Rachel Gardner</a> and Laura Ray Wearren.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">But the innovator's bug has been itching worse and worse lately, pushing me to expand my skill-set and programming abilities at a more rapid pace. While family issues landed me in Savannah originally following the <a href="http://www.theblacksheartimes.com/articles/2012/03/18/obituaries/doc4f662f194f297177971782.txt" target="_blank">death of my dad </a>in May 2012, my mom and I have had nearly a year-and-a-half to heal, and it's time for my next chapter. Given NYC's burgeoning tech/entrepreneurial scene, I finally decided this week to make a leap of faith into the big data startup community, as well as (possibly) explore new ways of building stronger, more informed communities.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">I'll keep you posted.</p>
