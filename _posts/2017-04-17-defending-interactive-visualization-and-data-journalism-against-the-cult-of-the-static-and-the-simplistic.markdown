*Tufte's illustration of what he famously dubbed 'The Flatland' –– the two-dimensional, static and shallow state of information graphics –– in his 1980 work* Envisioning Information


In Dec. 2014, the *[Economist](http://economist.com)* boldly proclaimed in its popular "[Graphic Detail](http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail)" blog that "the genre of interactive visualization is leaping ahead of static charts . . . Online, interactive charts will become the norm, nudging aside paper-based, static ones." The proclamation from the British-based, internationally-circulated newsweekly was hardly a unique or revolutionary one for its time; indeed, the comments reflected a forming consensus  among thought-leaders in the publishing and data visualization communities that a new era of democratization was finally making it possible for *interactive* data visualization to go mainstream.

Fast forward two-years to 2016, and the very same people and institutions who  previously lauded the era of data democratization
