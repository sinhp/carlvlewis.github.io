As the founding brigade captain for [Open Savannah](https://opensavannah.org/), a Code for America brigade, I helped customize and build out a node.js+react CMS called ‘brigadehub’ in collaboration with Code for San Francisco. The CMS powers our website, and integrates with the GitHub and Meetup APIs to sync events and pull in projects.
