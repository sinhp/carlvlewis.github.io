[MercerCluster.com](http://mercercluster.com/) – In February 2011, I created the first ever online edition for my university’s student newspaper, The Mercer Cluster. The site uses WordPress as its content management system, and allows individual section editors to post their content in a simple and familiar manner. It includes multimedia capabilities, social networking integration and a jQuery slider and news ticker. See the site live [here](http://mercercluster.com/).
