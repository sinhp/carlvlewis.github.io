[OxfordStudent.com](http://oxfordstudent.com/) – While serving as news editor for Oxford University’s weekly student-run newspaper, The Oxford Student, I developed a new Web site for the publication in April 2010. I replaced the clunky previous site with a fresh, streamlined publishing system with a clean design and simple editing tools. The site now receives about 6,000 views a day, and has dramatically increased the paper’s readership by creating a stronger online presence.
