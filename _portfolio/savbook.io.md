[SavBook.io](http://savbook.io/) is the result of a hacknight I led for [Open Savannah](https://opensavannah.org/), the 100+ member volunteer civic tech organization that serves as an official brigade of [Code for America](http://codeforamerica.org/). It is built using react.js, node and webpack, and uses Tabletop.js to pull in data from Google Sheets as an API. It is meant to serve as an open data approach to the social service silo problem.
