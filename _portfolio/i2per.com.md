Project task: Design an interactive, content-rich interface for a special feature series on unemployment in the Bronx.

Project description: Reporters at The Bronx Ink recently set out to tell the stories of six Bronx residents struggling to find work and make ends meet in a borough where the unemployment rate continues to hover at a staggering 12.4 percent. These are the everyday Bronxites searching to find work. These are the 12 percent.
