Embedded above is a pure JavaScript-powered flowchart from a [team project](http://carlvlewis2.wpengine.com/dmchallenge) that was part of Columbia University’s Tow Center for Digital Journalism annual 24-hour digital media hackathon. The project took home first place at the end of the hackathon. I served as the team leader, divvying up content and slides to team members who later iFramed in their content under tight deadlines. I built this particular interactive in less than an hour from scratch using CSS3, HTML5 and JavaScript elements.

I also oversaw the larger presentation, including customizing the open-source [Coda Slider jQuery](http://kevinbatdorf.github.io/codaslider/) plugin to work within our project’s constraints, and performing data analysis to ensure our team’s conclusions were of statistical significance. Other team members who participated in the project included [Stephanie Vatz](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/stephanie-vatz/22/630/601), [Rani Molla](https://twitter.com/ranimolla), [Erin Richey](https://twitter.com/ErinCRichey) and Kelty Ortiz.

And, of course, the semester-long preparation we received from [Prof. Susan E. McGregor](http://susanemcgregor.com/) (and the donuts halfway in!) shouldn’t go unnoticed.
