For a city with a modest population of around 100,000, Macon, Ga. has a stunning 500 to 800 homeless people living on its streets. While numerous aid organizations in the city offer free meals, places to sleep and assistance in the job search, Macon’s homeless population lacks a safe and comfortable place to go during the day, leading many of them to congregate at a downtown fountain. This 2011 short-form documentary by Carl V. Lewis and Rachel Finley focuses on the effort to bring a day-shelter to Macon, which would provide the homeless with a roof over their heads and protect them from the the searing southern heat.
