An interactive HTML5 [flow chart](http://carlvlewis2.wpengine.com/syria) that accompanies Daniel Medina’s [piece](http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/29/a-virtual-community-helping-to-power-the-effort-in-syria/) in the New York Times about how U.S.-based Syrian activists are funneling money and resources to aid the revolution.
