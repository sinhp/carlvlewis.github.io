For my final project at [Savannah Morning News](http://savannahnow.com/), my team undertook a massive two-week overhaul of the company’s mobile news app, which had previously been tethered to a legacy, contracted vendor that allowed us little flexibility and provided a poor user experience.

As much as I’m an advocate of open-source, the time constraints for this project simply didn’t allow us that flexibility. So, we went with an awesome, [pay-per-month vendor](http://shoutem.com/) that gave us complete autonomy over design for a small fee per month.
