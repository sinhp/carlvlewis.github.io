[dataviz.tools](http://dataviz.tools/) is a side-project in which I condensed my bookmark stash of 974 tools/resources on data visualization and winnowed down the list to 350 of the best open-source tools and resources for data visualization and information design on the web. Since launching it in Jan. 2017, it has received more than 43,000 unique visitors.
