## Hi, I'm Carl, and this is my digital sandbox on the web. 

I'm a twenty-something interactive web developer, computational data designer, civic technologist, data journalist and digital educator. I believe democracy is at its strongest when we have an informed and engaged citizenry, and it is incumbent upon both the private sector and the public sector to ensure the information needs of communities are met in the twenty-first century in an independent and fact-fueled manner. That conviction is what led me to spend most of my career up until recently in newsrooms, working as an in-house innovator in interactive-graphics and [data-driven journalism](http://towcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/). 

That's a vague way of saying that I've taken on projects as complex as scraping public data from government databases using Python and visualizing that data in d3.js, and as myriad as delivering workshops to veteran journalists on the use of social media as a reporting tool. I started out as a beat reporter at 19 at [The Macon Telegraph](http://macon.com), where I filed exactly 892 news stories during my time in college at [Mercer University](http://mercer.edu). My year overseas at [Oxford University](http://oxford.edu) saw me rise to the top of the editorial staff of [The Oxford Student](http://oxfordstudent.com), oversee a digital redesign and pen numerous [nationally-syndicated investigations](http://datavisualizi.ng/enterprise/print/the%20oxford%20student/slay-the-jews/).
